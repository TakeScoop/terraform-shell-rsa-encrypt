# Short description of this project
description: |-
  The `terraform-shell-rsa-encrypt` module can be used for encrypting content using an RSA public key.
  It is the missing part of the built-in "rsadecrypt".

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  When `rsadecrypt` was implemented into terraform, the `encrypt` command was [left out](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/16647)


# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  Here's how to invoke this example module in your projects

  ```hcl
  module "encrypt" {
    source = "zeroae/shell/rsa-encrypt"

    public_key_pem = file("path/to/public-key.pem")
    content_base64 = filebase64("path/to/sensitive.txt")
  }
  ```
